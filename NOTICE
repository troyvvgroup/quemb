Initial development of quemb was started by Oinam Romesh Meitei (2023).
It partially contained parts from earlier codes of the Van Voorhis group,
such as the Quasi Newton Optimization which was written by Hong-Zhou Ye,

The development branched off in November 2024 (see the tag `last_version_before_forking`)
and was henceforth carried in alphabetic order by:
- Minsik Cho
- Beck Hanscam
- Aleksandr Trofimov
- Oskar Weser
- Shaun Weatherly
- Leah Weisburn
